# Rocketry & Control Systems

This folder contains projects related to rocket flight dynamics, attitude control, and propulsion-oriented simulation.

When I found out that I cannot build an actual model rocket, I wasn't ready to throw everything out the window. Hence, I decided to turn it into a computational project. The emphasis is on modeling rockets as dynamic systems with changing mass, nonlinear forces, and control constraints.

## Included projects
- Model rocket flight simulator
- PID control implementation (Simulink)
- Reinforcement learning–based attitude control

These projects connect physical modeling, control theory, and simulation to better understand how rockets behave beyond idealized equations.
