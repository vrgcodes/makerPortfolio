This project is a simple embedded feedback system designed to warn a driver when their vehicle gets too close to another object.

An ultrasonic sensor measures distance in real time and triggers a sound whose frequency changes with proximity, giving the driver a sense of how close they are.

## Key ideas
- Real-time distance sensing using an ultrasonic sensor
- Audio feedback scaled with distance rather than a fixed alarm
- A potentiometer to allow manual adjustment of alert volume

I focused on making the system practical rather than just functional, especially in the context of a low-income country (like Kenya) avoiding constant, irritating alerts while still providing useful feedback in dense traffic situations.
