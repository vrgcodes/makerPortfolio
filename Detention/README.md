# Detention Management System (Python)

This project is a detention tracking system built to reduce manual administrative work.

It automates common tasks such as:
- Student lookup and record updates
- Attendance tracking
- Reducing reliance on spreadsheets and manual cross-checking

This version focuses on core logic and usability, while a more complete web-based system is maintained in a separate repository.
