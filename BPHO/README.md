# BPhO Computational Challenge

This project was completed as part of the British Physics Olympiad Computational Challenge, where I explored orbital mechanics and solar system dynamics using numerical methods and visualization.

The work involved building models from first principles with a focus on understanding how physical laws translate into computation.

## What I worked on
- Verified Kepler’s Third Law using real solar system data
- Modeled elliptical orbits for inner and outer planets
- Built 2D and 3D orbit visualizations and animations
- Implemented numerical integration to relate orbital time and angle
- Explored non-coplanar motion using Pluto’s inclined orbit
- Created additional visualizations such as planetary spirographs

I also built a simple GUI to explore and visualize results interactively.
This submission was awarded **Gold** in the computational challenge.

This project strengthened my intuition for orbital dynamics,
numerical stability, and scientific visualization.
