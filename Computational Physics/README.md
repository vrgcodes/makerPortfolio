# Computational Physics

This folder contains small physics simulations built to explore how analytical equations behave when implemented numerically.

Some of these projects were guided by tutorials, but I treated them as learning exercises: rewriting code, experimenting with parameters, and focusing on understanding the underlying physics principles rather than just replicating results.

## Included projects
- Double pendulum (chaotic dynamics)
- Projectile motion and trajectory analysis
- Quantum tunneling (time-dependent and steady-state)

The emphasis across these projects is on numerical integration, stability, and visualization of physical behavior.
