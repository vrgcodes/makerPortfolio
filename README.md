# Engineering Projects – Veer Gudhka

This repository contains engineering projects that covr
rocketry, control systems, physics-based simulation, embedded systems,
and full-stack software.

Across these projects, my focus has been on understanding systems
end-to-end, starting from physical models and assumptions, translating
them into computation, and then testing ideas through simulation,
hardware, or user-facing tools.

The projects are grouped by domain. Each folder contains a
dedicated README explaining the motivation, approach, and key design
decisions behind the work.

## Project Groups

### 🚀 Rocketry & Control
- Rocket flight simulation (single- and multi-stage)
- PID and reinforcement learning attitude control
- Control-oriented modeling and visualization

### 🧠 Computational Physics
- BPhO Computational Challenge (Gold Award)
- Classical and quantum system simulations

### 🔧 Embedded & Systems
- Door security system (face recognition + embedded control)
- Car proximity warning system

### 🧩 Administrative & Software Systems
- Detention management system

These projects reflect both coursework-driven curiosity and independent
initiative beyond formal classes.
